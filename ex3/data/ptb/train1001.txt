 a form of asbestos once used to make kent cigarette filters has caused a high percentage of cancer deaths among a group of workers exposed to it more than N years ago researchers reported 
 the asbestos fiber <unk> is unusually <unk> once it enters the <unk> with even brief exposures to it causing symptoms that show up decades later researchers said 
 <unk> inc. the unit of new york-based <unk> corp. that makes kent cigarettes stopped using <unk> in its <unk> cigarette filters in N 
 although preliminary findings were reported more than a year ago the latest results appear in today 's new england journal of medicine a forum likely to bring new attention to the problem 
 a <unk> <unk> said this is an old story 
 we 're talking about years ago before anyone heard of asbestos having any questionable properties 
 there is no asbestos in our products now 
 neither <unk> nor the researchers who studied the workers were aware of any research on smokers of the kent cigarettes 
 we have no useful information on whether users are at risk said james a. <unk> of boston 's <unk> cancer institute 
 dr. <unk> led a team of researchers from the national cancer institute and the medical schools of harvard university and boston university 
 the <unk> spokeswoman said asbestos was used in very modest amounts in making paper for the filters in the early 1950s and replaced with a different type of <unk> in N 
 from N to N N billion kent cigarettes with the filters were sold the company said 
 among N men who worked closely with the substance N have died more than three times the expected number 
 four of the five surviving workers have <unk> diseases including three with recently <unk> cancer 
 the total of N deaths from malignant <unk> lung cancer and <unk> was far higher than expected the researchers said 
 the <unk> rate is a striking finding among those of us who study <unk> diseases said dr. <unk> 
 the percentage of lung cancer deaths among the workers at the west <unk> mass. paper factory appears to be the highest for any asbestos workers studied in western industrialized countries he said 
 the plant which is owned by <unk> & <unk> co. was under contract with <unk> to make the cigarette filters 
 the finding probably will support those who argue that the u.s. should regulate the class of asbestos including <unk> more <unk> than the common kind of asbestos <unk> found in most schools and other buildings dr. <unk> said 
 the u.s. is one of the few industrialized nations that does n't have a higher standard of regulation for the smooth <unk> fibers such as <unk> that are classified as <unk> according to <unk> t. <unk> a professor of <unk> at the university of vermont college of medicine 
 more common <unk> fibers are <unk> and are more easily rejected by the body dr. <unk> explained 
 in july the environmental protection agency imposed a gradual ban on virtually all uses of asbestos 
 by N almost all remaining uses of <unk> asbestos will be outlawed 
 about N workers at a factory that made paper for the kent filters were exposed to asbestos in the 1950s 
 areas of the factory were particularly dusty where the <unk> was used 
 workers dumped large <unk> <unk> of the imported material into a huge <unk> poured in cotton and <unk> fibers and <unk> mixed the dry fibers in a process used to make filters 
 workers described clouds of blue dust that hung over parts of the factory even though <unk> fans <unk> the area 
 there 's no question that some of those workers and managers contracted <unk> diseases said <unk> phillips vice president of human resources for <unk> & <unk> 
 but you have to recognize that these events took place N years ago 
 it has no bearing on our work force today

 john rowe president and chief executive officer of new england electric said the company 's return on equity could suffer if it made a higher bid and its forecasts related to ps of new hampshire such as growth in electricity demand and improved operating <unk> did n't come true 
 when we <unk> raising our bid the risks seemed substantial and persistent over the next five years and the rewards seemed a long way out 
 that got hard to take he added 
 mr. rowe also noted that political concerns also worried new england electric 
 no matter who owns ps of new hampshire after it emerges from bankruptcy proceedings its rates will be among the highest in the nation he said 
 that attracts attention 
 it was just another one of the risk factors that led to the company 's decision to withdraw from the bidding he added 
 wilbur ross jr. of rothschild inc. the financial adviser to the troubled company 's equity holders said the withdrawal of new england electric might speed up the reorganization process 
 the fact that new england proposed lower rate increases N N over seven years against around N N boosts proposed by the other two outside bidders complicated negotiations with state officials mr. ross asserted

 commonwealth edison co. was ordered to refund about $ N million to its current and former <unk> for illegal rates collected for cost overruns on a nuclear power plant 
 the refund was about $ N million more than previously ordered by the illinois commerce commission and trade groups said it may be the largest ever required of a state or local utility 
 state court judge richard curry ordered edison to make average refunds of about $ N to $ N each to edison customers who have received electric service since april N including about two million customers who have moved during that period 
 judge curry ordered the refunds to begin feb. N and said that he would n't <unk> any appeals or other attempts to block his order by commonwealth edison 
 the refund pool may not be held <unk> through another round of appeals judge curry said 
 commonwealth edison said it is already appealing the underlying commission order and is considering appealing judge curry 's order 
 the exact amount of the refund will be determined next year based on actual <unk> made until dec. N of this year 
 commonwealth edison said the ruling could force it to slash its N earnings by $ N a share

 the illinois supreme court ordered the commission to audit commonwealth edison 's construction expenses and refund any <unk> expenses 
 the utility has been collecting for the plant 's construction cost from its N million customers subject to a refund since N 
 in august the commission ruled that between $ N million and $ N million of the plant 's construction cost was <unk> and should be <unk> plus interest

 the survival of spinoff cray computer corp. as a fledgling in the supercomputer business appears to depend heavily on the creativity and <unk> of its chairman and chief designer seymour cray 
 not only is development of the new company 's initial machine tied directly to mr. cray so is its balance sheet 
 documents filed with the securities and exchange commission on the pending spinoff disclosed that cray research inc. will withdraw the almost $ N million in financing it is providing the new firm if mr. cray leaves or if the <unk> project he heads is scrapped 
 the documents also said that although the <unk> mr. cray has been working on the project for more than six years the cray-3 machine is at least another year away from a fully operational prototype 
 moreover there have been no orders for the cray-3 so far though the company says it is talking with several prospects 
 while many of the risks were anticipated when <unk> cray research first announced the spinoff in may the <unk> it attached to the financing had n't been made public until yesterday 
 we did n't have much of a choice cray computer 's chief financial officer gregory <unk> said in an interview 
 the theory is that seymour is the chief designer of the cray-3 and without him it could not be completed 
 cray research did not want to fund a project that did not include seymour 
 the documents also said that cray computer anticipates <unk> perhaps another $ N million in financing beginning next september 
 but mr. <unk> called that a <unk> scenario 
 the filing on the details of the spinoff caused cray research stock to jump $ N yesterday to close at $ N in new york stock exchange composite trading 
 analysts noted yesterday that cray research 's decision to link its $ N million <unk> note to mr. cray 's presence will complicate a valuation of the new company 
 it has to be considered as an additional risk for the investor said gary p. <unk> of <unk> group inc. minneapolis 
 cray computer will be a concept stock he said 
 you either believe seymour can do it again or you do n't 
 besides the designer 's age other risk factors for mr. cray 's new company include the cray-3 's tricky <unk> chip technology 
 the sec documents describe those chips which are made of <unk> <unk> as being so fragile and minute they will require special <unk> handling equipment 
 in addition the cray-3 will contain N processors twice as many as the largest current supercomputer 
 cray computer also will face intense competition not only from cray research which has about N N of the world-wide supercomputer market and which is expected to roll out the <unk> machine a direct competitor with the cray-3 in N 
 the spinoff also will compete with international business machines corp. and japan 's big three hitachi ltd. nec corp. and fujitsu ltd 
 the new company said it believes there are fewer than N potential customers for <unk> priced between $ N million and $ N million presumably the cray-3 price range 
 under terms of the spinoff cray research stockholders are to receive one cray computer share for every two cray research shares they own in a distribution expected to occur in about two weeks 
 no price for the new shares has been set 
 instead the companies will leave it up to the marketplace to decide 
 cray computer has applied to trade on nasdaq 
 analysts calculate cray computer 's initial book value at about $ N a share 
 along with the note cray research is <unk> about $ N million in assets primarily those related to the cray-3 development which has been a drain on cray research 's earnings 
 <unk> balance sheets clearly show why cray research favored the spinoff 
 without the cray-3 research and development expenses the company would have been able to report a profit of $ N million for the first half of N rather than the $ N million it posted 
 on the other hand had it existed then cray computer would have incurred a $ N million loss 
 mr. cray who could n't be reached for comment will work for the new colorado springs colo. company as an independent contractor the arrangement he had with cray research 
 regarded as the father of the supercomputer mr. cray was paid $ N at cray research last year 
 at cray computer he will be paid $ N 
 besides messrs. cray and <unk> other senior management at the company includes neil <unk> N president and chief executive officer joseph m. <unk> N vice president engineering malcolm a. <unk> N vice president software and douglas r. <unk> N vice president hardware

 they will remain on a <unk> list that includes N other countries 
 those countries including japan italy canada greece and spain are still of some concern to the u.s. but are deemed to pose <unk> problems for american patent and copyright owners than those on the priority list 
 gary hoffman a washington lawyer specializing in <unk> cases said the threat of u.s. <unk> combined with a growing recognition that protecting intellectual property is in a country 's own interest prompted the improvements made by south korea taiwan and saudi arabia 
 what this tells us is that u.s. trade law is working he said 
 he said mexico could be one of the next countries to be removed from the priority list because of its efforts to craft a new patent law 
 mrs. hills said that the u.s. is still concerned about disturbing developments in turkey and continuing slow progress in malaysia

 earlier this year japanese investors snapped up a similar $ N million mortgage-backed securities mutual fund 
 that fund was put together by blackstone group a new york investment bank 
 the latest two funds were assembled jointly by goldman sachs & co. of the u.s. and japan 's daiwa securities co 
 the new seven-year funds one offering a fixed-rate return and the other with a floating-rate return linked to the london interbank offered rate offer two key advantages to japanese investors 
 first they are designed to eliminate the risk of prepayment mortgage-backed securities can be retired early if interest rates decline and such prepayment forces investors to <unk> their money at lower rates 
 second they channel monthly mortgage payments into semiannual payments reducing the administrative burden on investors 
 by addressing those problems mr. maxwell said the new funds have become extremely attractive to japanese and other investors outside the u.s. 
 such devices have boosted japanese investment in mortgage-backed securities to more than N N of the $ N billion in such instruments outstanding and their purchases are growing at a rapid rate 
 they also have become large purchasers of fannie mae 's corporate debt buying $ N billion in fannie mae bonds during the first nine months of the year or almost a <unk> of the total amount issued

 italian chemical giant montedison <unk> through its montedison acquisition n.v. indirect unit began its $ <unk> tender offer for all the common shares outstanding of erbamont n.v. a maker of pharmaceuticals incorporated in the netherlands 
 the offer advertised in today 's editions of the wall street journal is scheduled to expire at the end of november 
 montedison currently owns about N N of erbamont 's common shares outstanding 
 the offer is being launched <unk> to a previously announced agreement between the companies 
 japan 's reserves of gold convertible foreign currencies and special drawing rights fell by a hefty $ N billion in october to $ N billion the finance ministry said 
 the total marks the sixth consecutive monthly decline 
 the <unk> downturn reflects the intensity of bank of japan <unk> intervention since june when the u.s. currency temporarily surged above the N yen level 
 the announcement follows a sharper $ N billion decline in the country 's foreign reserves in september to $ N billion 
 pick a country any country 
 it 's the latest investment craze sweeping wall street a rash of new closed-end country funds those publicly traded portfolios that invest in stocks of a single foreign country 
 no fewer than N country funds have been launched or registered with regulators this year triple the level of all of N according to charles e. simon & co. a washington-based research firm 
 the turf recently has ranged from chile to <unk> to portugal 
 next week the philippine fund 's launch will be capped by a visit by philippine president <unk> aquino the first time a head of state has kicked off an issue at the big board here

 anything 's possible how about the new guinea fund <unk> george foot a managing partner at <unk> management associates of <unk> mass 
 the recent explosion of country funds <unk> the closed-end fund mania of the 1920s mr. foot says when narrowly focused funds grew wildly popular 
 they fell into <unk> after the N crash 
 unlike traditional <unk> mutual funds most of these <unk> portfolios are the closed-end type issuing a fixed number of shares that trade publicly 
 the surge brings to nearly N the number of country funds that are or soon will be listed in new york or london 
 these funds now account for several billions of dollars in assets 
 people are looking to stake their claims now before the number of available nations runs out says michael porter an analyst at smith barney harris upham & co. new york 
 behind all the <unk> is some <unk> competition 
 as individual investors have turned away from the stock market over the years securities firms have scrambled to find new products that brokers find easy to sell 
 and the firms are stretching their <unk> far and wide to do it 
 financial planners often urge investors to diversify and to hold a <unk> of international securities 
 and many emerging markets have <unk> more mature markets such as the u.s. and japan 
 country funds offer an easy way to get a taste of foreign stocks without the hard research of seeking out individual companies 
 but it does n't take much to get burned 
 political and currency gyrations can <unk> the funds 
 another concern the funds ' share prices tend to swing more than the broader market 
 when the stock market dropped nearly N N oct. N for instance the mexico fund plunged about N N and the spain fund fell N N 
 and most country funds were clobbered more than most stocks after the N crash 
 what 's so wild about the funds ' frenzy right now is that many are trading at historically fat premiums to the value of their underlying portfolios 
 after trading at an average discount of more than N N in late N and part of last year country funds currently trade at an average premium of N N 
 the reason share prices of many of these funds this year have climbed much more sharply than the foreign stocks they hold 
 it 's probably worth paying a premium for funds that invest in markets that are partially closed to foreign investors such as south korea some specialists say 
 but some european funds recently have skyrocketed spain fund has surged to a startling N N premium 
 it has been targeted by japanese investors as a good long-term play tied to N 's european economic integration 
 and several new funds that are n't even fully invested yet have jumped to trade at big premiums 
 i 'm very alarmed to see these rich <unk> says smith barney 's mr. porter 
 the newly <unk> premiums reflect the increasingly global marketing of some country funds mr. porter suggests 
 unlike many u.s. investors those in asia or europe seeking <unk> exposure may be less <unk> to paying higher prices for country funds 
 there may be an international viewpoint cast on the funds listed here mr. porter says 
 nonetheless plenty of u.s. analysts and money managers are <unk> at the <unk> trading levels of some country funds 
 they argue that u.s. investors often can buy american depositary receipts on the big stocks in many funds these so-called adrs represent shares of foreign companies traded in the u.s. 
 that way investors can essentially buy the funds without paying the premium 
 for people who insist on jumping in now to buy the funds <unk> 's mr. foot says the only advice i have for these folks is that those who come to the party late had better be ready to leave quickly 
 the u.s. and soviet union are holding technical talks about possible repayment by moscow of $ N million in <unk> russian debts owed to the u.s. government the state department said 
 if the debts are repaid it could clear the way for soviet bonds to be sold in the u.s. 
 however after two meetings with the soviets a state department spokesman said that it 's too early to say whether that will happen 
 <unk> with the talks the state department said it has permitted a soviet bank to open a new york branch 
 the branch of the bank for foreign economic affairs was approved last spring and opened in july 
 but a soviet bank here would be <unk> unless moscow found a way to settle the $ N million debt which was lent to the country 's short-lived democratic <unk> government before the communists seized power in N 
 under a N law the johnson debt default act as amended it 's illegal for americans to extend credit to countries in default to the u.s. government unless they are members of the world bank and international monetary fund 
 the u.s.s.r. belongs to neither organization 
 moscow has settled <unk> debts with other countries in recent years at less than face value 
 the state department stressed the <unk> debts as the key to satisfying the johnson act 
 but the soviets might still face legal obstacles to raising money in the u.s. until they settle hundreds of millions of dollars in additional debt still outstanding from the world war ii <unk> program 
 in another reflection that the growth of the economy is <unk> off the government said that orders for manufactured goods and spending on construction failed to rise in september 
 meanwhile the national association of purchasing management said its latest survey indicated that the manufacturing economy contracted in october for the sixth consecutive month 
 its index inched up to N N in october from N N in september 
 any reading below N N suggests the manufacturing sector is generally declining 
 the purchasing managers however also said that orders turned up in october after four months of decline 
 factories booked $ N billion in orders in september nearly the same as the $ N billion in august the commerce department said 
 if not for a N N surge in orders for capital goods by defense contractors factory orders would have fallen N N 
 in a separate report the department said construction spending ran at an annual rate of $ N billion not significantly different from the $ N billion reported for august 
 private construction spending was down but government building activity was up 
 the figures in both reports were adjusted to remove the effects of usual seasonal patterns but were n't adjusted for inflation 
 kenneth <unk> economist for society corp. a cleveland bank said demand for exports of factory goods is beginning to <unk> off 
 at the same time the drop in interest rates since the spring has failed to revive the residential construction industry 
 what sector is stepping forward to pick up the slack he asked 
 i draw a blank 
 by most measures the nation 's industrial sector is now growing very slowly if at all 
 factory <unk> fell in september 
 so did the federal reserve board 's <unk> index 
 yet many economists are n't predicting that the economy is about to slip into recession 
 they cite a lack of imbalances that provide early warning signals of a downturn 
 inventories are closely watched for such clues for instance 
 economists say a buildup in inventories can <unk> cutbacks in production that can lead to a recession 
 but yesterday 's factory orders report had good news on that front it said factory inventories fell N N in september the first decline since february N 
 this <unk> to the soft landing scenario said elliott <unk> an economist at donaldson lufkin & jenrette securities corp 
 i do n't see any signs that inventories are excessive 
 a soft landing is an economic slowdown that <unk> inflation without leading to a recession 
 the department said orders for <unk> goods those intended to last fewer than three years fell N N in september to $ N billion after climbing N N the month before 
 orders for durable goods were up N N to $ N billion after rising N N the month before 
 the department previously estimated that <unk> orders fell N N in september 
 factory shipments fell N N to $ N billion after rising N N in august 
 shipments have been relatively level since january the commerce department noted 
 manufacturers ' backlogs of unfilled orders rose N N in september to $ N billion helped by strength in the defense capital goods sector 
 excluding these orders backlogs declined N N 
 in its construction spending report the commerce department said residential construction which accounts for nearly half of all construction spending was off N N in september to an annual rate of $ N billion 
 david <unk> economist for the mortgage bankers association predicted the drop in interest rates eventually will boost spending on single-family homes but probably not until early next year 
 spending on private <unk> construction was off N N to an annual rate of $ N billion with no sector showing strength 
 government construction spending rose N N to $ N billion 
 after adjusting for inflation the commerce department said construction spending did n't change in september 
 for the first nine months of the year total construction spending ran about N N above last year 's level 
 the government 's construction spending figures contrast with a report issued earlier in the week by mcgraw-hill inc. 's <unk> dodge group 
 dodge reported an N N increase in construction contracts awarded in september 
 the <unk> counts money as it is spent dodge counts contracts when they are awarded 
 the government includes money spent on residential <unk> dodge does n't 
 although the purchasing managers ' index continues to indicate a slowing economy it is n't <unk> an imminent recession said robert <unk> chairman of the association 's survey committee and director of materials management at pitney bowes inc. stamford conn 
 he said the index would have to be in the low N N range for several months to be considered a forecast of recession 
 the report offered new evidence that the nation 's export growth though still continuing may be slowing 
 only N N of the purchasing managers reported better export orders in october down from N N in september 
 and N N said export orders were down last month compared with N N the month before 
 the <unk> managers ' report also added evidence that inflation is under control 
 for the fifth consecutive month purchasing managers said prices for the goods they purchased fell 
 the decline was even <unk> than in september 
 they also said that vendors were delivering goods more quickly in october than they had for each of the five previous months 
 economists consider that a sign that <unk> pressures are <unk> 
 when demand is stronger than suppliers can handle and delivery times <unk> prices tend to rise 
 the purchasing managers ' report is based on data provided by more than N purchasing executives 
 each of the survey 's indicators <unk> the difference between the number of purchasers reporting improvement in a particular area and the number reporting a worsening 
 for the first time the october survey polled members on imports 
 it found that of the N N who import N N said they imported more in october and N N said they imported less than the previous month 
 while acknowledging one month 's figures do n't prove a trend mr. <unk> said it does lead you to suspect imports are going down or at least not increasing that much 
 items listed as being in short supply numbered only about a dozen but they included one <unk> milk and milk <unk> 
 it 's an odd thing to put on the list mr. <unk> noted 
 he said that for the second month in a row food processors reported a shortage of <unk> dry milk 
 they blamed increased demand for dairy products at a time of exceptionally high u.s. exports of dry milk coupled with very low import quotas

 it 's probably true that many <unk> put in <unk> overtime just for the <unk> of solidarity that the system is so <unk> that only the assistant manager can talk to the manager and the manager to the general manager and that sony was <unk> of letting a young short-term american employee take on any responsibility 
 all of this must have been <unk> frustrating to mr. <unk> who went to sony with degrees in business and computer science and was <unk> to <unk> another <unk>

 this is the year the negative ad for years a secondary presence in most political campaigns became the main event 
 the irony is that the attack commercial after getting a boost in last year 's presidential campaign has come of age in an <unk> election year with only a few <unk> scattered across the country 
 but in the three leading political <unk> of N the negative ads have reached new levels of <unk> raising fears that this kind of <unk> empty of significant issues is <unk> in a new era of campaigns without content 
 now says joseph <unk> a pioneer in political television the idea is to attack first last and always 
 a trend that started with the first <unk> of politics accelerated with the <unk> of the television age and became a <unk> art form in N has reached an entirely new stage 
 to get people 's attention these days says douglas <unk> a political consultant your tv ad needs to be bold and entertaining and more often than not that means <unk> 
 and unlike a few years ago you do n't even have to worry whether the ad is <unk> 
 in N as often as not the principal fights in the major campaigns are prompted by the ads themselves 
 take a look then at the main attack commercials that set the tone for tuesday 's elections in new york city new jersey and virginia 
 new york city 
 the screen <unk> with a small tight <unk> shot of david dinkins democratic candidate for mayor of new york city 
 david dinkins failed to file his income taxes for four straight years says a <unk> male voice 
 and then this television commercial paid for by republican rudolph giuliani 's campaign and produced by roger <unk> the master of negative tv ads really gets down to business 
 mr. dinkins the ad charges also failed to report his campaign contributions accurately <unk> his links to a failing insurance company and paid a convicted <unk> through a phony organization with no members no receipts and no office 
 david dinkins says the <unk> why does he always wait until he 's caught 
 nasty <unk> says john <unk> mr. dinkins 's issues director designed to <unk> a case of political corruption that simply does n't exist 
 <unk> by the giuliani ads mr. dinkins 's tv consultants robert <unk> and david <unk> finally <unk> a negative ad of their own 
 the screen shows two distorted <unk> photos presumably of two politicians 
 compare two candidates for mayor says the announcer 
 one says he 's for banning <unk> bullets 
 the other has opposed a ban on <unk> bullets 
 one claims he 's pro-choice 
 the other has opposed a woman 's right to choose 
 funny thing says the <unk> both these candidates are named rudolph giuliani 
 who 's telling the truth 
 everybody and nobody 
 it 's a classic situation of ads that are true but not always fully accurate 
 mr. dinkins did fail to file his income taxes for four years but he insists he voluntarily admitted the oversight when he was being considered for a city job 
 he was on the board of an insurance company with financial problems but he insists he made no secret of it 
 the city 's campaign finance board has refused to pay mr. dinkins $ N in matching funds because his campaign records are incomplete 
 the campaign has blamed these reporting problems on computer errors 
 and says mr. dinkins he did n't know the man his campaign paid for a <unk> effort had been convicted of <unk> 
 but say mr. dinkins 's managers he did have an office and his organization did have members 
 mr. giuliani 's campaign chairman peter powers says the dinkins ad is deceptive 
 the other side he argues knows giuliani has always been pro-choice even though he has personal reservations 
 they know he is generally opposed to <unk> bullets but that he had some reservations about the language in the legislation 
 virginia 
 democratic <unk> gov. douglas wilder opened his gubernatorial battle with republican marshall coleman with an abortion commercial produced by frank <unk> that analysts of every political <unk> agree was a tour de force 
 against a shot of <unk> <unk> on an american flag an announcer talks about the strong tradition of freedom and individual liberty that <unk> have <unk> for generations 
 then just as an image of the <unk> of thomas jefferson <unk> from the screen the announcer continues on the issue of abortion marshall coleman wants to take away your right to choose and give it to the politicians 
 that commercial which said mr. coleman wanted to take away the right of abortion even in cases of rape and incest a charge mr. coleman denies changed the dynamics of the campaign <unk> it at least in part into a <unk> on abortion 
 the ad prompted mr. coleman the former virginia attorney general to launch a series of advertisements created by bob goodman and designed to shake mr. wilder 's support among the very women who were attracted by the abortion ad 
 the coleman <unk> featured a <unk> of a young woman in <unk> and the ad suggested that she was <unk> an <unk> courtroom <unk> 
 a voice says <unk> now do n't you have <unk> 
 then an announcer <unk> it was douglas wilder who introduced a bill to force rape victims age N and younger to be <unk> about their private lives by lawyers for accused <unk> 
 so the next time mr. wilder talks about the rights of women ask him about this law he tried to pass 
 mr. wilder did introduce such legislation N years ago but he did so at the request of a <unk> a common legislative technique used by lawmakers 
 the legislation itself noted that it was introduced by request and in N mr. wilder introduced a bill to protect rape victims from <unk> <unk> 
 people have grown tired of these ads and coleman has gotten the <unk> of being a negative <unk> says mark <unk> a political scientist at mary washington college 
 wilder has managed to get across the idea that coleman will say anything to get elected governor and more important has been able to put the <unk> for all the negative <unk> on coleman 
 mr. coleman said this week that he would devote the remainder of the political season to positive <unk> but the truce lasted only hours 
 by tuesday night television stations were carrying new ads featuring mr. coleman himself raising questions about mr. wilder 's <unk> to rape victims 
 new jersey 
 the attacks began when democratic rep. james florio aired an ad featuring a drawing of <unk> and a photograph of mr. florio 's rival republican rep. jim courter 
 remember <unk> says a female voice 
 consider jim courter 
 and then this commercial produced by bob <unk> gets down to its own mean and <unk> business 
 pictures of <unk> oil <unk> <unk> into focus and the female voice <unk> that hazardous waste on his mr. courter 's property the neighbors are suing for consumer fraud 
 and the nose on mr. courter 's face grows 
 the only fraud involved cry mr. courter 's <unk> is the florio commercial itself and so the courter campaign has responded with its own <unk> commercial produced by mr. <unk> 
 in this one the screen <unk> with photographs of both candidates 
 who 's really lying asks a female voice 
 florio 's lying the voice goes on because the barrel on courter 's land contained heating oil was <unk> up and caused no pollution 
 mr. courter 's long nose <unk> while mr. florio 's grows 
 who 's telling the truth 
 stephen <unk> a political scientist at new jersey 's <unk> institute says it 's another example of an ad that 's true but not fully accurate 
 barrels were dumped on the courter property a complaint was made but there is no evidence the barrels were a serious threat to the environment 
 even so according to mr. <unk> the ad was devastating because it raised questions about mr. courter 's credibility 
 but it 's building on a long tradition 
 in N on route to a re-election rout of democrat frank <unk> gop gov. nelson rockefeller of new york appeared in person saying if you want to keep the crime rates high <unk> is your man

 japanese investment in southeast asia is <unk> the region toward economic integration 
 interviews with analysts and business people in the u.s. suggest that japanese capital may produce the economic cooperation that southeast asian politicians have pursued in fits and starts for decades 
 but japan 's power in the region also is <unk> fears of domination and <unk> fresh policy questions 
 the flow of japanese funds has set in motion a process <unk> these economies will be <unk> together by the great japanese investment machine says robert <unk> vice chairman of goldman sachs international corp 
 in the past five years japanese companies have tripled their commitments in asia to $ N billion 
 in thailand for example the government 's board of investment approved $ N million of japanese investment in N N times the u.s. investment figure for the year 
 japan 's commitment in southeast asia also includes steep increases in foreign assistance and trade 
 asia 's other <unk> countries are following japan 's lead and pumping capital into the region 
 in taiwan and south korea rising wages are forcing manufacturers to seek other overseas sites for <unk> production 
 these nations known as asia 's little <unk> also are contributing to southeast asia 's integration but their influence will remain subordinate to japan 's 
 for <unk> countries such as thailand and malaysia the investment will provide needed jobs and spur growth 
 but asian nations ' harsh memories of their military domination by japan in the early part of this century make them fearful of falling under japanese economic <unk> now 
 because of budget constraints in washington the u.s. encourages japan to share economic burdens in the region 
 but it <unk> yielding political ground 
 in the coming decade analysts say <unk> relations will be tested as tokyo comes to terms with its new status as the region 's economic <unk> 
 japan 's swelling investment in southeast asia is part of its economic evolution 
 in the past decade japanese manufacturers concentrated on domestic production for export 
 in the 1990s spurred by rising labor costs and the strong yen these companies will increasingly turn themselves into <unk> with plants around the world 
 to capture the investment southeast asian nations will move to accommodate japanese business 
 these nations ' internal decisions will be made in a way not to <unk> their largest aid <unk> largest private investor and largest lender says richard <unk> director of the international business and research program at the university of southern california 's graduate school of business 
 japanese money will help turn southeast asia into a more <unk> economic region 
 but analysts say asian cooperation is n't likely to parallel the european common market approach 
 rather japanese investment will spur integration of certain sectors says kent <unk> a specialist in east asian economies at the <unk> wilson school for public and <unk> affairs at princeton university 
 in electronics for example a japanese company might make television picture <unk> in japan <unk> the sets in malaysia and export them to indonesia 
 the effect will be to pull asia together not as a common market but as an integrated production zone says goldman sachs 's mr. <unk> 
 countries in the region also are beginning to consider a <unk> for closer economic and political ties 
 the economic and foreign ministers of N asian and pacific nations will meet in australia next week to discuss global trade issues as well as regional matters such as transportation and telecommunications 
 participants will include the u.s. australia canada japan south korea and new zealand as well as the six members of the association of southeast asian nations thailand malaysia singapore indonesia the philippines and <unk> 
 in addition the u.s. this year offered its own plan for cooperation around the pacific <unk> in a major speech by secretary of state james baker following up a proposal made in january by australian prime minister bob <unk> 
 the baker proposal <unk> washington 's intention to continue playing a leading political role in the region 
 in asia as in europe a new order is taking shape mr. baker said 
 the u.s. with its regional friends must play a crucial role in designing its architecture 
 but maintaining u.s. influence will be difficult in the face of japanese dominance in the region 
 japan not only <unk> the u.s. in investment flows but also <unk> it in trade with most southeast asian countries although the u.s. remains the leading trade partner for all of asia 
 moreover the japanese government now the world 's largest aid <unk> is pumping far more assistance into the region than the u.s. is 
 while u.s. officials voice optimism about japan 's <unk> role in asia they also convey an <unk> of caution 
 there 's an understanding on the part of the u.s. that japan has to expand its functions in asia says j. michael <unk> undersecretary of commerce for trade 
 if they approach it with a <unk> <unk> attitude there will be a net gain for everyone 
 some asian nations are <unk> about washington 's demand that tokyo step up its military spending to ease the u.s. security burden in the region 
 the issue is further complicated by uncertainty over the future of the u.s. 's leases on military bases in the philippines and by a possible u.s. troop reduction in south korea 
 many <unk> regard a u.s. presence as a desirable <unk> to japanese influence 
 no one wants the u.s. to pick up its <unk> and go home mr. <unk> says 
 for their part taiwan and south korea are expected to step up their own investments in the next decade to try to slow the japanese <unk> 
 they do n't want japan to <unk> the region and <unk> it up says <unk> lee professor of east asian politics at the university of pennsylvania 
 <unk> rice could hardly believe her eyes 
 while giving the comprehensive test of basic skills to ninth <unk> at greenville high school last march N she spotted a student looking at <unk> sheets 
 she had seen cheating before but these notes were <unk> 
 a <unk> is an example of a profession in trade and finance 
 at the end of world war ii germany surrendered before japan 
 the <unk> conference committee is used when a bill is passed by the house and senate in different forms 
 virtually word for word the notes matched questions and answers on the <unk> section of the test the student was taking 
 in fact the student had the answers to almost all of the N questions in that section 
 the student surrendered the notes but not without a protest 
 my teacher said it was ok for me to use the notes on the test he said 
 the teacher in question was nancy yeargin considered by many students and parents to be one of the best at the school 
 confronted mrs. yeargin admitted she had given the questions and answers two days before the examination to two <unk> geography classes 
 she had gone so far as to display the questions on an overhead <unk> and <unk> the answers 
 mrs. yeargin was fired and prosecuted under an unusual south carolina law that makes it a crime to breach test security 
 in september she pleaded guilty and paid a $ N fine 
 her alternative was N days in jail 
 her story is partly one of personal <unk> 
 she was an <unk> teacher who won <unk> and inspired students but she will probably never teach again 
 in her wake she left the <unk> and anger of a principal who was her friend and now calls her a <unk> of colleagues who say she brought them shame of students and parents who defended her and insist she was treated <unk> and of <unk> officials stunned that despite the <unk> nature of her actions she became something of a local <unk> 
 mrs. yeargin 's case also <unk> some light on the dark side of school reform where pressures on teachers are growing and where <unk> testing has enhanced the temptation to <unk> 
 the N statute mrs. yeargin violated was designed to enforce provisions of south carolina 's <unk> laws 
 prosecutors alleged that she was trying to bolster students ' scores to win a bonus under the state 's N education improvement act 
 the bonus depended on her ability to produce higher <unk> scores 
 there is incredible pressure on school systems and teachers to raise test scores says walt <unk> an education professor and testing specialist at boston college 
 so efforts to beat the tests are also on the rise 
 and most disturbing it is educators not students who are blamed for much of the wrongdoing 
 a <unk> study released in september by friends for education an <unk> n.m. <unk> group concluded that outright cheating by american educators is common 
 the group says standardized achievement test scores are greatly inflated because teachers often teach the test as mrs. yeargin did although most are never caught 
 evidence of widespread cheating has surfaced in several states in the last year or so 
 california 's education department suspects adult responsibility for <unk> at N schools that changed wrong answers to right ones on a statewide test 
 after numerous <unk> of questionable teacher help to students texas is <unk> its security practices 
 and sales of <unk> booklets for classroom instruction are booming 
 these materials including <unk> school publishing co. 's scoring high and learning materials are nothing short of sophisticated <unk> sheets according to some recent academic research 
 by using them teachers with administrative blessing telegraph to students <unk> the precise areas on which a test will concentrate and sometimes give away a few exact questions and answers 
 use of scoring high is widespread in south carolina and common in greenville county mrs. yeargin 's school district 
 experts say there is n't another state in the country where tests mean as much as they do in south carolina 
 under the state 's education improvement act low test scores can block students ' promotions or force entire districts into <unk> <unk> <unk> that can mean <unk> 
 high test scores on the other hand bring recognition and extra money a new computer lab for a school grants for special projects a bonus for the <unk> 
 and south carolina says it is getting results 
 since the reforms went in place for example no state has posted a higher rate of improvement on the <unk> <unk> test than south carolina although the state still posts the lowest average score of the about N states who use the sat as the primary college <unk> examination 
 critics say south carolina is paying a price by stressing improved test scores so much 
 friends of education rates south carolina one of the worst seven states in its study on academic cheating 
 says the organization 's founder john <unk> <unk> mrs. yeargin is a way for administrators to protect themselves and look like they take cheating seriously when in fact they do n't take it seriously at all 
 paul <unk> director of testing for the south carolina department of education says mr. <unk> 's allegations of cheating are <unk> without foundation and based on unfair <unk> 
 partly because of worries about potential abuse however he says the state will begin keeping closer track of <unk> preparation booklets next spring 
 south carolina 's reforms were designed for schools like greenville high school 
 standing on a <unk> hill in a <unk> area of this old textile city the school has educated many of south carolina 's best and <unk> including the state 's last two governors nobel prize winning <unk> charles <unk> and actress <unk> <unk> 
 but by the early 1980s its glory had faded like the yellow bricks of its broad <unk> 
 it was full of violence and gangs and kids cutting class says linda ward the school 's principal 
 crime was awful test scores were low and there was no <unk> in <unk> programs 
 mrs. ward took over in N becoming the school 's seventh principal in N years 
 her immediate predecessor suffered a nervous breakdown 
 prior to his term a teacher <unk> to death in the halls <unk> by a student 
 <unk> mrs. ward says the school was having trouble serving in harmony its two <unk> and evenly split student groups a <unk> white elite from old <unk> neighborhoods and blacks many of them poor from <unk> inner city neighborhoods 
 mrs. ward resolved to clean out <unk> in the school 's faculty and restore safety and she also had some new factors working in her behalf 
 one was statewide school reform which raised overall educational funding and <unk> in a new public spirit for school <unk> 
 another was nancy yeargin who came to greenville in N full of the energy and ambitions that reformers wanted to reward 
 being a teacher just became my life says the <unk> mrs. yeargin a teacher for N years before her dismissal 
 i loved the school its history 
 i even <unk> about school and new things to do with my students 
 while mrs. ward fired and restructured staff and struggled to improve <unk> mrs. yeargin worked <unk> days and fast became a student favorite 
 in N and N she applied for and won bonus pay under the reform law 
 encouraged by mrs. ward mrs. yeargin taught honor students in the state teacher <unk> program a reform creation designed to encourage good students to consider teaching as a career 
 she won grant money for the school advised <unk> ran the <unk> club proposed and taught a new cultural <unk> class in western <unk> and was chosen by the school <unk> as teacher of the year 
 she was an <unk> lady she had it all together says <unk> <unk> a freshman at the university of south carolina who had mrs. yeargin in the <unk> class last year 
 she says that because of mrs. yeargin she gave up ambitions in architecture and is studying to become a teacher 
 mary beth <unk> a greenville <unk> <unk> also says mrs. yeargin inspired her to go into education 
 she taught us more in western <unk> than i 've ever learned in other classes says <unk> green a greenville senior 
 in the classroom students say mrs. yeargin distinguished herself by <unk> teaching approaches forcing kids to pair up to complete classroom work or using <unk> type <unk> 
 on <unk> she came to work to prepare study plans or sometimes even to polish the furniture in her classroom 
 she just never gave it up says mary <unk> mary beth 's mother 
 you 'd see her <unk> <unk> in the stands at a football game 
 some fellow teachers however viewed mrs. yeargin as <unk> and too yielding to students 
 mrs. ward says she often defended her to colleagues who called her a <unk> 
 pressures began to build 
 friends told her she was pushing too hard 
 because of deteriorating hearing she told colleagues she feared she might not be able to teach much longer 
 mrs. yeargin 's extra work was also helping her earn points in the state 's <unk> program 
 but the most important source of points was student improvement on tests 
 huge gains by her students in N and N meant a total of $ N in bonuses over two years a meaningful addition to her annual salary of $ N 
 winning a bonus for a third year was n't that important to her mrs. yeargin insists 
 but others at greenville high say she was eager to win if not for money then for pride and recognition 
 mary elizabeth <unk> another <unk> teacher says she believed mrs. yeargin wanted to keep her standing high so she could get a new job that would n't demand good hearing 
 indeed mrs. yeargin was interested in a possible job with the state teacher <unk> program 
 last march after attending a teaching <unk> in washington mrs. yeargin says she returned to greenville two days before annual testing feeling that she had n't prepared her <unk> geography students adequately 
 when test booklets were passed out N hours ahead of time she says she <unk> questions in the social studies section and gave the answers to students 
 mrs. yeargin admits she made a big mistake but insists her <unk> were correct 
 i was trying to help kids in an unfair testing situation she says 
 only five of the N questions were geography questions 
 the rest were history <unk> finance subjects they never had 
 mrs. yeargin says that she also wanted to help lift greenville high school 's overall test scores usually near the bottom of N district high schools in <unk> carried annually by local newspapers 
 mostly she says she wanted to prevent the damage to <unk> that her <unk> students would suffer from doing badly on the test 
 these kids broke my heart she says 
 a whole day goes by and no one even knows they 're alive 
 they desperately needed somebody who showed they <unk> for them who loved them 
 the last thing they needed was another <unk> blow 
 school officials and prosecutors say mrs. yeargin is lying 
 they found students in an advanced class a year earlier who said she gave them similar help although because the case was n't tried in court this evidence was never presented publicly 
 that pretty much <unk> any <unk> that she was out to help the poor <unk> child says joe watson the prosecutor in the case who is also president of greenville high school 's <unk> association 
 mrs. yeargin concedes that she went over the questions in the earlier class adding i wanted to help all students 
 mr. watson says mrs. yeargin never complained to school officials that the standardized test was unfair 
 do i have much <unk> for her mr. watson asks 
 not really 
 i believe in the system 
 i believe you have to use the system to change it 
 what she did was like taking the law into your own hands 
 mrs. ward says that when the cheating was discovered she wanted to avoid the <unk> public disclosure that a trial would bring 
 she says she offered mrs. yeargin a quiet resignation and thought she could help save her teaching certificate 
 mrs. yeargin declined 
 she said something like you just want to make it easy for the school 
 i was <unk> mrs. ward recalls 
 it was like someone had turned a <unk> in me 
 to the <unk> and <unk> of her <unk> and legal authorities and perhaps as a measure of the <unk> of standardized tests <unk> yeargin won widespread local support 
 the <unk> hearing at which she was dismissed was crowded with students teachers and parents who came to testify on her behalf 
 supportive callers <unk> unfair testing not mrs. yeargin on a local radio talk show on which she appeared 
 the show did n't give the <unk> of mrs. yeargin 's <unk> saying only that she helped students do better on the test 
 the message to the board of education out of all this is we 've got to take a serious look at how we 're doing our <unk> and our testing policies in this state said the <unk> host 
 <unk> in the greenville newspaper allowed that mrs. yeargin was wrong but also said the case showed how testing was being <unk> 
 the radio show <unk> us says mrs. ward 
 partly because of the show mr. watson says the district decided not to recommend mrs. yeargin for a first-time offenders program that could have <unk> the charges and the conviction from her record 
 and legal authorities <unk> up an investigation worthy of a murder case 
 over N witnesses mostly students were interviewed 
 at greenville high school meanwhile some students especially on the <unk> <unk> were crushed 
 it 's hard to explain to a <unk> why someone they like had to go says mrs. ward 
 soon <unk> appeared in the <unk> that carried the school 's familiar <unk> <unk> <unk> on the front 
 on the back the shirts read we have all the answers 
 many colleagues are angry at mrs. yeargin 
 she did a lot of harm says <unk> rice who had discovered the <unk> notes 
 we work damn hard at what we do for damn little pay and what she did cast unfair <unk> on all of us 
 but several teachers also say the incident <unk> doubt on the wisdom of evaluating teachers or schools by using standardized test scores 
 says <unk> key a <unk> teacher the incentive pay thing has opened up a can of <unk> 
 there may be others doing what she did 
 mrs. yeargin says she pleaded guilty because she realized it would no longer be possible to win <unk> and because she was afraid of further charges 
 mrs. ward for one was relieved 
 despite the strong evidence against mrs. yeargin popular sentiment was so strong in her favor mrs. ward says that i 'm afraid a jury would n't have convicted her 
 since <unk> first touched slate <unk> have wanted to know what 's on the test 
 these days students can often find the answer in <unk> <unk> and <unk> their teachers give them in the weeks prior to taking standardized achievement tests 
 the <unk> section of the widely used california achievement test asks fifth <unk> what is another name for the roman <unk> <unk> 
 it also asks them to add <unk> and <unk> 
 <unk> in a <unk> <unk> called learning materials sold to schools across the country by <unk> school publishing co. contain the same questions 
 in many other <unk> there is almost no difference between the real test and learning materials 
 what 's more the test and learning materials are both produced by the same company <unk> a joint venture of mcgraw-hill inc. and macmillan 's parent britain 's maxwell communication corp 
 close parallels between tests and practice tests are common some educators and researchers say 
 <unk> booklets software and <unk> are a booming publishing <unk> 
 but some practice products are so similar to the tests themselves that critics say they represent a form of <unk> cheating 
 if i took these preparation booklets into my classroom i 'd have a hard time <unk> to my students and parents that it was n't cheating says john <unk> a <unk> city mich. teacher who has studied test <unk> 
 he and other critics say such <unk> aids can defeat the purpose of standardized tests which is to gauge learning progress 
 it 's as if france decided to give only french history questions to students in a european history class and when everybody <unk> the test they say their kids are good in european history says john <unk> an <unk> n.m. <unk> and founder of an educational research organization friends for education which has studied standardized testing 
 standardized achievement tests are given about N million times a year across the country to students generally from <unk> through eighth grade 
 the most widely used of these tests are <unk> 's cat and comprehensive test of basic skills the iowa test of basic skills by <unk> <unk> co. and <unk> <unk> <unk> inc. 's metropolitan achievement test and stanford achievement test 
 sales figures of the <unk> materials are n't known but their reach into schools is significant 
 in arizona california florida louisiana maryland new jersey south carolina and texas educators say they are common classroom tools 
 <unk> says well over N million of its scoring high <unk> books have been sold since their introduction N years ago with most sales in the last five years 
 about N sets of learning materials teachers ' <unk> have also been sold in the past four years 
 the materials in each set reach about N students 
 scoring high and learning materials are the <unk> preparation tests 
 michael kean director of marketing for <unk> <unk> the <unk> division that publishes learning materials says it is n't aimed at improving test scores 
 he also asserted that exact questions were n't <unk> 
 when referred to the questions that matched he said it was <unk> 
 mr. <unk> the <unk> and william <unk> a michigan state university education professor concluded in a study last june that cat test versions of scoring high and learning materials should n't be used in the classroom because of their similarity to the actual test 
 they devised a <unk> scale <unk> one point for each <unk> measured on the cat test to rate the <unk> of test <unk> to the <unk> cat 
 because many of these <unk> the <unk> of <unk> figures metric measurement of volume or pie and bar <unk> for example are only a small part of the total <unk> <unk> mr. <unk> says the preparation <unk> would n't <unk> too many if their real intent was general instruction or even general <unk> with test procedures 
 but learning materials matched on N of N <unk> 
 scoring high matched on N 
 in cat sections where students ' knowledge of <unk> <unk> sounds is tested the authors noted that scoring high concentrated on the same sounds that the test does to the exclusion of other sounds that fifth <unk> should know 
 learning materials for the <unk> contains at least a dozen examples of exact matches or close parallels to test items 
 rick <unk> senior editor of scoring high says that messrs. <unk> and <unk> are ignoring the need students have for becoming familiar with tests and testing format 
 he said authors of scoring high <unk> avoid <unk> exact questions but he does n't deny that some items are similar 
 when scoring high first came out in N it was a publication of random house 
 mcgraw-hill was <unk> 
 in a N advisory to educators mcgraw-hill said scoring high should n't be used because it represented a parallel form of the cat and <unk> tests 
 but in N mcgraw-hill purchased the random house unit that publishes scoring high which later became part of <unk> 
 messrs. <unk> and kean say they are <unk> of any efforts by mcgraw-hill to modify or <unk> scoring high 
 <unk> corp. said it completed the acquisition of sacramento savings & loan association from the <unk> & <unk> c. <unk> foundation for $ N million

 the department of health and human services plans to extend its <unk> on federal funding of research involving fetal-tissue transplants 
 medical researchers believe the <unk> of small amounts of <unk> tissue into humans could help treat <unk> <unk> and such <unk> diseases as <unk> 's <unk> 's and <unk> 's 
 but anti-abortionists oppose such research because they worry that the development of <unk> using fetal-tissue transplants could lead to an increase in abortions 
 james mason assistant secretary for health said the ban on federal funding of fetal-tissue transplant research should be continued indefinitely 
 he said the ban wo n't stop privately funded <unk> research or federally funded fetal-tissue research that does n't involve transplants 
 department officials say that hhs secretary louis sullivan will support dr. mason 's ruling which will be issued soon in the form of a letter to the acting director of the national institutes of health 
 both dr. mason and dr. sullivan oppose federal funding for abortion as does president bush except in cases where a woman 's life is threatened 
 the controversy began in N when the national institutes of health aware of the policy implications of its research asked for an hhs review of its plan to <unk> <unk> tissue into the brain of a patient suffering from <unk> 's disease 
 the department placed a <unk> on the research pending a review of scientific legal and ethical issues 
 a majority of an <unk> panel recommended late last year that the research continue under carefully controlled conditions but the issue became <unk> in politics as anti-abortion groups continued to oppose federal funding 
 the dispute has hampered the administration 's efforts to recruit prominent doctors to fill prestigious posts at the helm of the nih and the centers for disease control 
 several candidates have withdrawn their names from consideration after administration officials asked them for their views on abortion and fetal-tissue transplants 
 antonio novello whom mr. bush <unk> to serve as surgeon general reportedly has assured the administration that she opposes abortion 
 dr. novello is deputy director of the national institute of child health and human development 
 some researchers have charged that the administration is imposing new ideological tests for top scientific posts 
 earlier this week dr. sullivan tried to <unk> these charges by stressing that candidates to head the nih and the <unk> will be <unk> by standards of scientific and administrative <unk> not politics 
 but the administration 's handling of the fetal-tissue transplant issue <unk> many scientists 
 when scientific progress moves into <unk> ground there has to be a role for society to make judgments about its applications says <unk> <unk> associate dean of the yale medical school 
 the disturbing thing about this abortion issue is that the debate has become <unk> so that no mechanism exists for finding a middle ground 
 yale is one of the few medical institutions conducting privately funded research on fetal-tissue transplants 
 but dr. <unk> warns that dr. mason 's ruling may discourage private funding 
 the <unk> of federal funds and the climate in which the decision was made certainly do n't provide any incentive for one of the more visible foundations to provide support he said 
 despite the <unk> over transplants federal funding of research involving <unk> <unk> will continue on a number of fronts 
 such research may ultimately result in the ability to <unk> damaged <unk> or to turn off genes that cause cancer or to regulate genes that cause down 's syndrome the leading cause of mental <unk> according to an nih summary 
 the nih currently spends about $ N million annually on fetal-tissue research out of a total research budget of $ N billion

 the internal revenue service has threatened criminal sanctions against lawyers who fail to report detailed information about clients who pay them more than $ N in cash 
 the warnings issued to at least N criminal defense attorneys in several major cities in the last week have led to an outcry by members of the organized bar who claim the information is protected by <unk> privilege 
 the irs warnings stem from a N law that requires anyone who receives more than $ N in cash from a client or customer in one or more related transactions in the course of trade or business to report the payment on a document known as form N 
 the form asks for such details as the client 's name social security number <unk> number and details about the services provided for the payment 
 failure to complete the form had been punishable as a <unk> until last november when congress determined that the crime was a felony punishable by up to N years in prison 
 attorneys have argued since N when the law took effect that they can not provide information about clients who do n't wish their <unk> to be known 
 many attorneys have returned incomplete forms to the irs in recent years citing <unk> privilege 
 until last week the irs rarely acted on the incomplete forms 
 this form forces a lawyer to become in effect a witness against his client said neal r. <unk> president of the national association of criminal defense lawyers 
 the irs is asking lawyers to <unk> a criminal problem to the government added mr. <unk> a miami lawyer who has heard from dozens of attorneys who received letters in recent days and has himself received the <unk> irs forms sent by certified mail 
 mr. <unk> said that clients who pay cash may include alleged drug dealers who do n't have domestic bank accounts 
 these individuals may not necessarily be under investigation when they hire lawyers 
 mr. <unk> said there also may be other circumstances under which individuals would n't want the government to know they had retained criminal defense lawyers 
 filling out detailed forms about these individuals would tip the irs off and spark action against the clients he said

 michael ross a new york lawyer who heads the aba 's grand jury committee said that lawyers are prohibited by the aba 's code of ethics from disclosing information about a client except where a court orders it or to prevent the client from committing a criminal act that could result in death 
 mr. ross said he met with officials of the irs and the justice department which would bring any enforcement actions against taxpayers to discuss the issue last may 
 at that meeting he said the justice department assured him that enforcement procedures would n't be threatened against attorneys without further review and advance notice 
 mr. ross said irs officials opposed the justice department 's moderate stance on the matter 
 but in the letters sent in recent days christopher j. <unk> of the irs computing center in detroit told attorneys that failing to voluntarily submit the requested information could result in <unk> enforcement action being initiated 
 in some cases the irs asked for information dating back to forms it received in N 
 a spokesman for the irs confirmed that there has been <unk> <unk> about incomplete <unk> but he declined to say why the letters were sent to lawyers now 
 individuals familiar with the justice department 's policy said that justice officials had n't any knowledge of the irs 's actions in the last week 
 lawyers worry that if they provide information about clients that data could quickly end up in the hands of prosecutors 
 prosecutors need court permission to obtain the tax returns of an individual or a business 
 but they have obtained N forms without court permission and used the information to help develop criminal cases 
 some criminal lawyers speculated that the irs was sending the letters to test the issue
