# ACL Anthology
- CL avoid (huge papers)
- TACL (safe in terms of quality, feasibility depends)
- ACL+EACL+NAACL main conference, great place to look
- EMNLP also great
- CoNLL small but fine workshop
- *Sem/SemEval, probably avoid, very mathy

Avoid everything else.

# NIPS -> NeurIPS
Very theoretical

# ICML

# ICLR

# AISTATS
Not primarily deep learning
