Inject antonymy and synonymy into vector space representations.
Applying this to public pre-trained word vectors leads to new SOTA performance on SimLex-999

# Introduction
- Popular methods rely on the distributional hypothesis assumption
- Distributional hypothesis tends to coalesce semantically similar words with
  conceptual association.
- Popular methods tends to push antonyms and synonyms together
- Similarity/Antonymy can be application- or domain-specific
    + We want to explot distributional knowledge for dialogue state tracking (DST)

# DST
- In a dialogue system interprets users' utterances and updates belief state
    + Belief state is probability distribtion over all possible states of the dialogue
    + Eg. at restaurant DST would need to detect whether user wants cheap or expensive food
    + Distinguishing between semantically different yet conceptually related words is critical
        % Eg. (Cheaper and pricey)
- Propose method adressing these two using synonymy and antonymy relations from lexical resources
- Method: counter-fitting
    + Light weight post-processing procedure in the spirit of retrofitting
    + Applying counter-fitting to Paragram-SL999 we achieve new SOTA on SimLex-999

# Counter-fitting Word Vectors to Linguistic Constraints
- Initial vocabulary: V = {v_1, v_2,...,v_N}
- Updated vocabulary: V' = {v'_1, v'_2,...,v'_N}
- Constraints A and S, each of which are pairs (i,j)
    + S being indices of synonyms in V
    + A being indices of antonyms in V

- Objective functions to counter-fit pre-trained word vectors V:
    + Antonym Repel (AR)
    + Synonym Attract (SA)
    + Vector Space Preservation (VSP)

    Objective function for training procedure is weighted sum of three functions
    each with their own weight (hyperparams) k1, k2, k3

## DST
- Capture users goals given their utterances
- Goals represented as sets of contraints, by slot-value pairs
    + [food: Indian], [parking: allowed]

## Experiments
- Datasets
    + Vectors
        % Glove (300dim vectors)
        % Paragram-SL999 (300dim vector)
    + Synonymy/Antonymy constraints
        % PPDB 2.0
        % WordNet

        12802 antonymy pairs, 31,828 synonymy pairs for words in vocabulary.
        Vocabulary consists of 76,427 most frequent words in Open-Subtitles.
